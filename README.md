      - Download the zip file and open them on said enviornment

RUNNING:

      - In order to run the program, I personally use and recommend the commond prompt "gcc FILENAME.c" to make and "./a.out" to compile
      - Once compiled, follow the instructions prompted by the program, press the "Enter" key to commit any input
