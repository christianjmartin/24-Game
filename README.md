INSTALLATION: 

      - Make sure you have an enviornment on your local machine that is able to compile and run C.
      - Open a new workspace and create four files, and copy and paste the content into them from the files above in which share the same name:
          1. main.c (C source code file)
          2. easy.txt (text file for easy mode)
          3. medium.txt (text file for medium mode)
          4. hard.txt (text file for hard mode) 
      - Make sure to not mix up the file names and contents for the text files, as you will not get the desried gaming experience.

RUNNING:

      - In order to run the program, I personally use and recommend the commond prompt "gcc FILENAME.c" to make and "./a.out" to compile
      - Once compiled, follow the instructions prompted by the program, press the "Enter" key to commit any input
